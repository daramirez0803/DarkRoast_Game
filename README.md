# DarkRoast_Game
A game made for Georgia Tech CS6457 Summer 2024 session. Made in collaboration with Eddy Gao, Patrick Connor, Qing Yang, and Jiajia Chen.

The files contained are only the assets used in the game and the executables required to run it on either Windoes or OSX; these files are in the "Build" directory (The OSX executable was not playtested).
The source code for these files are located on my Georgia Tech Organization GitHub account (dramirez71@gatech.edu), but remain there in compliance with the Georgia Tech code of conduct wherein I cannot publically post code or solutions for projects done for their courses.
